# Objective:
Generate a comprehensive course outline for a software training course based on the provided research document. The outline will be used to create screen recording-based lessons for business professionals.

# Input:
A research document containing software features, UI workflows, and best practices.

# Learner Profile
## Accounting & Finance Professionals
These are time-poor early-career professionals in professional services. Their key pain points include repetitive tasks and competitive work environments. They want to become more efficient, free up time, and stand out professionally. Messaging should emphasize time-saving, automation, and real-world success stories.

## Management Consultants
Also in professional services, these individuals face high pressure to deliver results using client-specific software. Their goal is to upskill quickly and confidently. Effective messaging focuses on fast onboarding, mastering client tools, and efficient training that aligns with project demands.

## Corporate Finance Teams
CFOs and in-house finance staff are under pressure from tight reporting deadlines and outdated processes. Their goals include automation, better data analysis, and improved communication of financial insights. Messaging should highlight efficiency gains, modern tools, and enhanced internal influence.

# Output Requirements:
Create a course outline that includes:

## 1. Course Approach Decision
- **Vertical Approach**: Design around a single business function with persistent case study (e.g., "Tableau for Sales Analytics")
- **Horizontal Approach**: Organize by software features with isolated examples

## 2. Course Structure
```
Course Title: [Software] for [Purpose/Audience]
Course Approach: [Vertical/Horizontal]
Total Lessons: [Number]

Lesson 1: Introduction to [Software]
- Overview and interface navigation
- Basic setup and configuration

Lesson 2-[N]: [Feature-based titles]
- Features: [List 1-3 features per lesson]
- [For vertical: Case study checkpoint]

Lesson [Final]: Best Practices and Advanced Workflows
- Integration techniques
- Professional tips
```

## 3. Feature Distribution Guidelines
- Each course has about 8-15 lessons, with occasional outliers
- Ensure 3-5 minute screen recording potential per lesson
- Balance lesson complexity (1-3 features per lesson, for complex features, use 1 lesson for each feature, for simpler features, assign each feature to a chapter under lessons, max 3 features/chapters per lesson)
- For vertical approach: Specify the case study scenario

## 4. Content Selection

The input research document contains ALL the relevant features and functionalities of the software. This is your sole source to determine the content of the course. Usually not all content covered in the research document is needed for the course. A major and very important part of your job is to carefully select the content from the research document and compose the course outline. There are factors that you need to consider when selecting the right material from the research document, such as leaner profile, course length and density, internal logic flow through lessons, a sense of progression and topic grouping, comprehensiveness with respect to what is needed and what are redundant given the learner profiles, and any other reasonable consideration.

# Important Notes:
- First screen recording lesson (the first lesson is always an non screen recording intro lesson, the first screen recording lesson is typically the second lesson) always covers interface basics and setup, and no other lesson will repeat setup later unless it involves other unique setups
- Middle lessons focus on hands-on features
- Final 1-2 lessons cover best practices, safety & ethics related (if applicable) and workflow optimization
- Each lesson should be self-contained yet part of a logical progression
- Include explicit feature-to-lesson/chapter mapping
