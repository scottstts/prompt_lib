# Software Documentation Research Request

I need you to thoroughly research and document a software's user interface by extracting detailed information from its official documentation. This research will be used to create step-by-step screen recording guides, so I need extremely granular details about every UI element and interaction.

## Documentation Sources
**Primary documentation URL(s):**
[INSERT DOCUMENTATION LINK(S) HERE]

## Specific Focus Areas (Optional)
**If you want to focus on specific sections, list them here:**
- [e.g., Charting]
- [e.g., Layout]
- [e.g., Data Import]
- [Leave blank to research entire documentation]

## What I Need You to Do

### 1. Navigate Through All Documentation
- Start from the provided URL(s) and navigate through every linked page
- If I specified focus areas above, prioritize those sections but still document everything within them
- Follow all sub-links, tabs, and expandable content within each section
- Don't skip anything - even seemingly basic information might be crucial for the screen recording

### 2. Extract These Details for Every Feature

For each feature or function you encounter, document:

**How to Get There:**
- Where do users start? (e.g., "From the main dashboard...")
- What's the exact click path? (e.g., "Click File menu > New > Project")
- Are there alternative ways to access it? (keyboard shortcuts, right-click menus, etc.)

**What the Screen Shows:**
- What type of window opens? (popup, side panel, new page, modal dialog)
- List every button, menu, field, and option visible - use their EXACT labels
- Where is each element located on the screen?
- What are the default selections or values?
- Which fields are required vs optional?

**What Users Can Do:**
- Document every possible interaction:
  - What can be clicked?
  - What can be typed or entered?
  - What can be selected from dropdowns?
  - What happens when hovering over elements?
  - What right-click options are available?

**What Happens Next:**
- After each action, what changes on screen?
- What confirmation messages appear?
- What error messages might show up?
- Does anything load or process? How long?
- What new options become available?

**Real Examples:**
- Provide sample data for every input field
- Show format requirements (dates, numbers, text)
- Give examples of valid and invalid entries
- Include any character limits or special requirements

### 3. Pay Special Attention To

**From Screenshots/Images:**
- Describe the exact layout and position of elements
- Note any icons, colors, or visual indicators
- Document the sequence if multiple images show a process
- Identify what's clickable vs. informational

**From Videos:**
- Document every click and navigation step
- Note any narrated tips or best practices
- Capture keyboard shortcuts demonstrated
- Record timing between actions if relevant

**Complex Workflows:**
- For multi-step processes, document every intermediate screen
- Note what triggers different paths or options
- Identify any prerequisites or dependencies

### 4. Format Your Output Like This

```
## [Section Name] (e.g., "Charting")

### [Feature Name] (e.g., "Creating a Bar Chart")

**How to Access:**
- Primary Path: [Detailed steps]
- Alternative Path: [If applicable]
- Keyboard Shortcut: [If available]

**Interface Overview:**
- Window Type: [e.g., "Modal dialog box"]
- Window Title: "[Exact title]"
- Layout: [Brief description of sections/panels]

**Available Elements:**
- Button: "[Exact Label]" - Location: [where on screen] - Purpose: [what it does]
- Field: "[Field Name]" - Type: [text/dropdown/checkbox] - Required: [Yes/No]
- [Continue for all elements...]

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. User Action: [What to do] 
   → Result: [What happens on screen]
2. User Action: [Next step]
   → Result: [Screen response]
[Continue until feature is complete]

**Data Entry Examples:**
- [Field Name]: Example value: "[sample]", Format: [requirements]
- [Continue for all input fields]

**Possible Errors:**
- Scenario: [When this happens] → Error: "[Exact message]" → Solution: [How to fix]

**Tips from Documentation:**
- [Any best practices or efficiency tips mentioned]

### 5. Final Checklist

Your research document should be so detailed that someone who has never seen this software could:
- Find any feature by following your navigation instructions
- Know exactly what to click at every step
- Enter appropriate sample data in any field
- Anticipate what will happen after each action
- Handle any errors that might occur

**Remember:** I'll be using ONLY your research document to create the screen recording guide. If you don't document something, we won't know it exists or how to show it. When in doubt, include more detail rather than less.

Please organize the final document by feature/functionality, maintaining the format shown above. Include every single UI detail you encounter in the documentation.
