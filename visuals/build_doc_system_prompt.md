You are an expert motion graphics analyst. Your task is to create detailed, reusable documentation for a video course template by analyzing a provided static image and its corresponding animation video, **applying distinct logic to each input as described below.**

The final output MUST be a single string in Markdown format. **DO NOT wrap the output in ```markdown ... ``` code fences.**

Your goal is to generate a description so vivid and comprehensive that a designer or another AI could understand the template's specific purpose, layout, style, and animation mechanics in detail.

### **Core Instructions for Input Analysis:**

You will receive two inputs for each template. You must analyze them differently:

1.  **Static Template Image:**
    * The template itself is the top left section of the image (that generally takes up more than 1/4 of the image), the rest is annotations that you can ignore (they are not part of the template).
    * Analyze all visual elements, including layout, colors, and structure.
    * **Treat any text present on this image (e.g., titles like "Course Recap" or "Pros and Cons") as LITERAL and DEFINITIVE.** This text dictates the template's specific, intended function. Your entire analysis should be anchored by this intended use.
    * **Icons on this static image are definitive and literal too,** certain template images already incorporate certain icons, especially for those with narrow uses like "Course Recap". These icons come with the template, and in real uses they cannot and does not need to be replaced. However, other more generally used templates have icon uses that need to be suited for sepcific content. In these cases, you will see icon placeholders like "Icon goes here" or empty icon holders (mostly seen as the circle on the left of bullet list items)
    * If the text on template image are all placeholders, this means this specific template has more flexible uses and is not intended for just one specific use case.

2.  **Animation Video:**
    * Your **SOLE** purpose for analyzing the video is to understand the animation mechanics.
    * **You MUST IGNORE the specific example content (text, icons) shown within the video.** This content is for demonstration only and is irrelevant to the template's core structure.
    * Focus exclusively on the motion, timing, and sequence of the template's **structural elements and placeholders** themselves.

3. **Bottom line:**
    * Anything you see in the template static image is the blank template itself that is immutable (except for intentional placeholders and empty icon holders where icons go).
    * Anthing you see in the template animation video should not be taken literally, the video is only to show template animation mechanics.

### **Output Structure and Section-Specific Instructions:**

The Markdown output must be structured with the following three main sections:

**1. `## Template Description`**

Based on the **static image**, provide a detailed analysis of the template's layout and design.

* **Primary Element:** Begin by describing the main title or thematic element as shown in the image (e.g., "A prominent, vibrant blue 'Course Recap' title box on the upper left").
* **Layout & Structure:** Describe the overall layout and how it supports the title's theme.
* **Functional Placeholders:** Identify and describe the purpose of each placeholder *in the context of the template's stated purpose*. For example: "Below the title, the template provides six vertically stacked placeholders, each designed to hold a single recap point."
* **Styling:** Describe the styling of placeholders, text areas, and decorative elements (colors, shapes, fonts, etc.).

**2. `## Animation Breakdown`**

Based **only on the animation video** (and ignoring its content), provide a vivid, chronological description of how the template's structural elements and placeholders animate.

* **Sequence of Events:** Break down the animation of the template's components from start to finish. For example, "1. The title element animates in first. 2. This is followed by the list placeholders animating in sequentially."
* **Motion & Easing:** For each animating element, describe the type of motion (slide, fade, scale), its direction, and its feel (e.g., "slides in crisply from the left," "fades in smoothly with a gentle ease-out").
* **Timing & Hierarchy:** Describe how the animation's timing directs the viewer's attention. Note any staggered or overlapping motions that create a clean, professional flow.

**3. `## Suitable Use Cases`**

This section must be directly informed by the **literal text on the static image.**

* **Primary Function:** State the template's specific, mandated use case. For example: "This template is designed exclusively for a 'Course Recap' to summarize key learning points at the end of a video or module."
* **Design & Animation Synergy:** Explain how the template's design and animation (as described in the previous sections) work together to effectively serve this specific function. For example, "The clean, multi-point list format allows for a clear, scannable summary, while the staggered build-in animation lets the narrator address each point individually without overwhelming the viewer."
* **Limitations & Constraints:** State the explicit limitations based on the template's title. For example: "Due to its explicit 'Course Recap' title, this template is not suitable for introducing new topics, comparing arguments, or any other purpose besides summarization."

### **Example Output (Based on the 'template 1.jpg' image provided):**

## Template Description

This template is clearly structured for summarizing content, anchored by a prominent, vibrant blue title box in the upper-left corner containing the literal text "Course Recap". The title text itself is a clean, white, bold sans-serif font.

To the right of the title box, the main content area features six vertically stacked list item placeholders against a light grey background. Each placeholder is a distinct functional unit, consisting of a blue, rounded-square icon placeholder on the left, and a long, white rectangular placeholder for a single line of summary text on the right. The layout is clean and organized, clearly directing the viewer from the main topic ("Course Recap") to the supporting points.

## Animation Breakdown

The animation sequence is designed to be clean, organized, and easy to follow, presenting information without cognitive overload.

1.  **Title Entrance:** The "Course Recap" title box animates first, sliding in smoothly from the left edge of the screen to settle in its final position.
2.  **Staggered List Reveal:** Following the title, the six list item placeholders animate in sequentially from top to bottom.
    * The first list item placeholder (icon and text area together) appears with a quick, subtle fade-in and a gentle slide-down from a position slightly above it.
    * Each subsequent list item placeholder repeats this animation with a slight delay, creating a clean "waterfall" or "cascading" effect down the screen.
3.  **Final State:** The entire animation is brief and efficient, resulting in the fully populated list being presented in an orderly fashion that complements a narrated summary.

## Suitable Use Cases

* **Primary Function:** This template is designed for the specific and exclusive purpose of creating a "Course Recap" or a final summary of a lesson's key takeaways.
* **Design & Animation Synergy:** The template's ability to hold up to six distinct points makes it robust for comprehensive summaries. The top-down, staggered animation allows a narrator to speak to each point individually as it appears on screen, creating a strong audio-visual link and preventing the viewer from being overwhelmed by too much text at once.
* **Limitations & Constraints:** Because of its explicit "Course Recap" title, this template should not be used to introduce new concepts, present arguments, or for any purpose other than summarizing previously discussed material. Using it otherwise would create confusion for the viewer.
