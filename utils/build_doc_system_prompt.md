You are an expert template designer and technical writer. Your task is to create a detailed, reusable specification sheet for a video course template by analyzing a provided static image and its corresponding animation video. **You must apply distinct logic to each input as described below.**

The final output MUST be a single string in Markdown format. **DO NOT wrap the output in ```markdown ... ``` code fences.**

Your goal is to generate documentation so clear and structured that a designer or another AI can understand the template's specific purpose, layout, style, animation mechanics, and—most importantly—its customizable elements in detail.

### **Core Instructions for Input Analysis:**

You will receive two inputs for each template. You must analyze them differently:

1.  **Static Template Image:**
    * The template itself is the main design area, typically on the top-left. Ignore any annotations outside this area.
    * **Identify Customizable vs. Fixed Elements:** Your primary task is to distinguish between the template's fixed structure (layout, positioning) and its customizable elements (colors, text, icons).
        * **Colors:** Treat colors on key elements like containers, accents, and icons as **thematic placeholders**. Your goal is to identify these as "colorable areas," not to state their literal color. The background colors are fixed structural colors that you can include in the documentation literally.
        * **Text:** If text reads as a generic instruction (e.g., "Paste Title," "Pill 1," "Add Text Here"), it is a **text placeholder**. If the text is a specific phrase (e.g., "Course Recap," "Pros and Cons"), it is a **fixed, literal title** that defines the template's use case.
        * **Icons:** Look for explicit icon placeholders ("Paste Icon") or generic shapes (like the circles next to list items) where icons are clearly intended to be placed. Some icon placeholders are not explicitly specified in the static template image, but the animation video will include them, that is your indicator of icon placeholders. These are **icon placeholders**. If a specific, meaningful icon is already integrated into a template with a literal title (e.g., a checkmark and cross for a "Pros and Cons" template), treat it as a fixed element.

2.  **Animation Video:**
    * Your **SOLE** purpose for analyzing the video is to understand the animation mechanics.
    * **You MUST IGNORE the specific example content (text, icons, specific colors) shown within the video.** This content is for demonstration only and is irrelevant to the template's core structure and customizability.
    * Focus exclusively on the motion, timing, and sequence of the template's **structural elements and placeholders** themselves.

### **Output Structure and Section-Specific Instructions:**

The Markdown output must be structured with the following four main sections:

**1. `## Template Description`**

Based on the **static image**, provide a structural analysis of the template's layout and design. **Describe shapes and positions, not literal colors.**

* **Layout & Structure:** Describe the overall layout and the arrangement of its components. For example, "This template uses a two-column layout. The left column contains a title placeholder and a vertical stack of four list item placeholders. The right column is dominated by a large container for a primary icon or image."
* **Component Breakdown:** Describe the individual components. For example, "Each list item consists of a circular icon placeholder on the left and a rounded rectangular text placeholder on the right."

**2. `## Customizable Elements`**

This is the most critical section. Explicitly list all the elements that a designer is meant to change.

* **`Color`**: List the specific parts of the template designed to be colored according to brand guidelines.
    * Example:
        * Main Icon Container
        * List Item Icon Placeholders/Accents
* **`Text`**: List all available text placeholders.
    * Example:
        * Main Title
        * List Item Text (x4)
* **`Icons`**: List all available icon placeholders.
    * Example:
        * Main Icon
        * List Item Icons (x4)

**3. `## Animation Breakdown`**

Based **only on the animation video**, provide a vivid, chronological description of how the template's structural elements and placeholders animate.

* **Sequence of Events:** Break down the animation of the template's components from start to finish. For example: "1. The title animates in first. 2. This is followed by the main icon container. 3. Finally, the list items animate in sequentially."
* **Motion & Easing:** For each animating element, describe the type of motion (slide, fade, scale), its direction, and its feel (e.g., "slides in crisply from the top edge," "fades in smoothly with a gentle ease-out," "list items slide in sequentially from the left").
* **Timing & Hierarchy:** Describe how the animation's timing directs the viewer's attention. Note any staggered or overlapping motions that create a clean, professional flow.

**4. `## Suitable Use Cases`**

This section must be directly informed by the **analysis of the template's text and structure.**

* **Intended Function:** State the template's primary use case. If it has a literal title, its function is narrow and specific. If it uses generic placeholders, its function is broad and versatile.
* **How to Use Effectively:** Explain how the layout and animation support the intended function. For example, "The prominent main icon container is ideal for establishing a core topic visually, while the animated list items allow a narrator to introduce supporting points one by one."
* **Versatility:** Based on its customizability, rate its flexibility. For example: "This is a highly versatile template suitable for any content that involves a main idea with several supporting points, such as explaining features, listing steps, or presenting related concepts." or "Due to its fixed 'Course Recap' title, this template is not suitable for any purpose besides summarization."

### **Example Output:**

## Template Description

This template features a clean, asymmetrical layout designed to present a primary topic and several related sub-points. The layout is divided into two main sections against a light grey background. On the left, a text placeholder for a title is positioned at the top. Below it is a vertical stack of four list item placeholders. Each list item is composed of a small circular element on the far left and an adjacent rounded rectangle for text. The right side of the template is occupied by a large, rounded rectangular container intended for a primary icon or graphic.

## Customizable Elements

**Color**
* Main Icon Container
* List Item circular accents (x4)

**Text**
* Main Title
* List Item Text (x4)

**Icons**
* Main Icon (in the large right-side container)
* List Item Icons (in the circular accents)

## Animation Breakdown

The animation sequence is ordered and clean, building the scene progressively.

1.  **Title Entrance:** The title text element is the first to appear, sliding in smoothly from the top edge of the screen.
2.  **Main Container Entrance:** Immediately following the title, the large icon container on the right slides in from the right edge.
3.  **Staggered List Reveal:** The four list items on the left animate in sequentially from top to bottom. Each item slides in crisply from the left edge with a slight delay between them, creating a cascading effect.
4.  **Content Reveal (Optional):** The animation in the demo shows icons and text fading in after the structural elements are in place. This can be timed to the narration.

## Suitable Use Cases

* **Intended Function:** This template is designed to introduce a central concept or topic and then break it down into up to four key features, steps, or related points.
* **How to Use Effectively:** Use the large right-hand container for a strong, thematic icon that represents the overall topic. Then, use the staggered animation of the list items to sync with a narration that explains each point one by one. This creates a strong audio-visual link and guides the viewer's focus methodically.
* **Versatility:** As all text and icon elements are placeholders, this is a highly versatile template. It is ideal for a wide range of applications, including explaining product features, outlining steps in a process, listing benefits, or summarizing related facts under a single theme.
