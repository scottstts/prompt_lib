# Template 1

## Template Description
Template 1 features a clean, two-part horizontal layout against a light grey background. On the left sits a prominent, large, rounded square that serves as a fixed title container. To its right is a vertical stack of up to five list items. Each list item is composed of a small, square icon placeholder on the left and an adjacent, long, rounded rectangular placeholder for text. A thin accent line is positioned beneath the entire list, visually anchoring the component.

## Customizable Elements
**Color**
*   Title Container
*   List Item Icon Containers (x5)
*   Bottom Accent Line

**Text**
*   List Item Text (x5)

**Icons**
*   List Item Icons (x5)

## Animation Breakdown
The animation builds the template elements in a deliberate and visually appealing sequence.

1.  **Title Container Entrance:** The large "Course Recap" container slides in diagonally from the top-left corner with a smooth ease-out, establishing the topic.
2.  **Accent Line Draw:** Immediately after the title container settles, the thin accent line at the bottom animates, drawing itself across from left to right.
3.  **Staggered List Reveal:** The five list items animate in sequentially from top to bottom. Each item slides in crisply from the right edge with a slight delay between them, creating a clean, cascading effect that directs the viewer's eye down the list.

## Suitable Use Cases
*   **Intended Function:** Due to its fixed "Course Recap" title, this template is specifically designed for presenting a summary or agenda for a course, module, or lesson.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** The fixed title immediately sets the context. Use the customizable list items to present key topics, learning objectives, or module contents that will be covered. The staggered animation is perfect for syncing with a narration that introduces each point one by one.
*   **Versatility:** This is a low-versatility template. Its fixed title makes it unsuitable for general-purpose lists like features, pros/cons, or steps in a process. It excels at its specific purpose of outlining course content but is not recommended for other uses.

This template, identified as Template 2, is structured with a distinct two-column layout against a light grey background, designed for presenting a summary or outline.

*   **Layout & Structure:** The left column features a single, prominent, rounded rectangular container positioned in the upper-left corner. This container holds a fixed title. The right column is dedicated to a vertical list of up to five items. A thin, vertical accent line runs beneath the list items, connecting them visually.
*   **Component Breakdown:** Each list item is a horizontal group consisting of a rounded square on the left (for an icon) and a long, rounded rectangular container on the right (for text).

## Customizable Elements

**Color**
*   Main Title Container (left side)
*   List Item Icon Containers (x5)
*   Vertical Accent Line/Track

**Text**
*   List Item Text (x5)

**Icons**
*   List Item Icons (x5)

## Animation Breakdown

The animation unfolds in a clean, sequential manner, guiding the viewer's eye from the main topic to the supporting points.

1.  **Title Entrance:** The "Course Overview" container on the left animates first, sliding in smoothly from the top edge of the frame.
2.  **Track Reveal:** Immediately following the title, the vertical accent line on the right animates, appearing to "draw" itself downwards from the top.
3.  **Staggered List Reveal:** The five list items animate in sequentially from top to bottom. Each item as a whole (icon container and text container) slides in crisply from the right edge. The staggered timing creates a clean, cascading effect that builds the list progressively.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** Due to the fixed "Course Overview" title, this template is specifically designed to present a high-level summary, agenda, or table of contents for an educational course, lesson, or module.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** This template is ideal for the beginning of a video to set expectations, or at the end to recap key topics covered. The staggered animation allows a narrator to introduce each point in the syllabus or outline one by one, creating a clear and organized presentation.
*   **Versatility:** This is a **low-versatility** template. Its function is explicitly defined by the fixed title. It is highly effective for its intended purpose but is not suitable for general-purpose lists, feature breakdowns, or other content types that do not fit the "Course Overview" context.

# Template 3

## Template Description

This is Template 3, a minimalist and modern design for presenting a definition. The layout is clean and horizontally oriented against a light grey background. In the top-left corner, there is a small, rounded rectangular container with a fixed title. The main content area is centrally located on the left half of the screen, featuring two stacked text placeholders: a larger one for a title and a smaller one below it for descriptive text. The right side of the template is anchored by a large, white, rounded container that extends off-screen, creating an accent shape. Inside this container is a circular element intended for an icon.

## Customizable Elements

**Color**
*   Top-left Title Container
*   Circular Icon Accent

**Text**
*   Definition Title Placeholder ("Paste Definition Title")
*   Definition Body Placeholder ("Paste Definition")

**Icons**
*   Main Icon (inside the right-side circular accent)

## Animation Breakdown

The animation is swift and clean, assembling the components in a logical sequence.

1.  **Frame Entrance:** The animation begins with two elements moving simultaneously. The top-left title container slides in smoothly from the top edge, while the white accent container on the right slides in from the right edge. They come to a soft stop in unison.
2.  **Text Reveal:** Immediately after the frame is set, the main definition title text fades into view. This is followed by the definition body text, which fades in right after the title.
3.  **Icon Reveal:** As the text appears, the colored circular accent on the right scales up from its center, creating a "pop" effect. The icon within the circle then fades in to complete the animation.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** With its fixed "Word Definition" title, this template is specifically designed to define a key term, acronym, or concept.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** This template is ideal for quickly introducing new vocabulary to the viewer. The title placeholder should contain the term being defined, and the body placeholder should contain its definition. The icon should be a strong visual metaphor for the term to aid in memory and comprehension. The quick, clean animation ensures it can be used as a brief, informative interlude without disrupting the flow of the main content.
*   **Versatility:** Due to the fixed "Word Definition" text in the top-left container, this template has **low versatility**. It is purpose-built for definitions and is not suitable for other use cases like lists, comparisons, or general announcements without significant modification that goes against its core design.

# Template 4

## Template Description

Template 4 features a bold, split-screen layout designed for introductions. The composition is divided vertically into a narrow light grey column on the left and a dominant dark navy blue panel on the right. The left column contains two stacked placeholders: a prominent circle at the top (for a headshot or logo) and a long, rounded rectangular bar below it (for a title or name). The entire right-hand panel serves as a single, large container for a primary thematic icon or graphic.

## Customizable Elements

*   Main Thematic Icon (in the right-hand panel)

## Animation Breakdown

The animation sequence is clean, modern, and establishes a clear visual hierarchy.

1.  **Panel Entrance:** The animation begins with the large dark navy blue panel sliding in smoothly from the right edge of the screen. It settles to form the background for the right side of the template.
2.  **Headshot Reveal:** Immediately after the panel is in place, the circular headshot placeholder on the left appears. It scales up rapidly from its center, finishing with a subtle bounce effect that adds a dynamic feel.
3.  **Title Reveal:** Following the circle's appearance, the horizontal title bar placeholder slides down crisply from the top edge of the frame, coming to rest just below the circle.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** This template is purpose-built as an introduction card. Its primary use case is to introduce a course instructor, a webinar host, or a guest speaker, clearly displaying their image and name alongside a graphic representing the topic.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** The layout is perfect for establishing credibility and context at the start of a video. Place a professional headshot in the circle and the presenter's name and title in the text bar. The large icon on the right should visually summarize the video's or course's core theme (e.g., a "code" icon for a programming course). The animation focuses attention first on the topic and then introduces the expert.
*   **Versatility:** This is a highly focused yet adaptable template. While ideal for introducing people, it can also be used to introduce a company (logo in the circle, company name below) or a core concept (main icon in the circle, concept name below, and supporting graphic on the right). Its professional and clean aesthetic makes it suitable for corporate, educational, and tech-focused content.

*   **Layout & Structure:** The template is organized into two main visual zones. The top-left corner features a fixed title container. Below this and to the left, a large, prominent hexagonal container serves as the primary focal point for an image. The right side of the screen is occupied by a vertical stack of five list item placeholders.
*   **Component Breakdown:** The title is housed in a small, rounded rectangular pill. The main image container is a hexagon with rounded corners. Each of the five list items is a long, pill-shaped horizontal container with a circular placeholder at its left end, designed to hold an icon.

## Customizable Elements

## Animation Breakdown

The animation unfolds in a deliberate sequence designed to establish a subject and then present related information.

1.  **Main Container Entrance:** The animation begins with the large hexagonal container, which scales up from the center while fading into view. This immediately establishes the primary subject of the slide.
2.  **Title Reveal:** Following the hexagon, the "Case Study" title container slides in crisply from the left edge of the screen, settling into its position in the top-left corner.
3.  **Staggered List Animation:** The five list item containers on the right animate in sequentially from top to bottom. Each container slides in from the left edge with a slight delay, creating a clean, cascading effect that guides the viewer's eye down the list.
4.  **Content Population:** Once the structural containers are in place, the corresponding icon and text for each list item fade into view one by one, allowing for synchronization with a voice-over.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** With its fixed "Case Study" title, Template 5 is purpose-built for presenting information about a specific subject, person, or company. It excels at showcasing testimonials, project outcomes, or individual profiles.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** Use the hexagonal container for a professional headshot, company logo, or a key image representing the case study's subject. The five list items can then be used to detail achievements, responsibilities, project results, or key takeaways. The staggered animation allows a narrator to introduce each point clearly and methodically.
*   **Versatility:** This template has low versatility. The fixed "Case Study" title strictly defines its use case, making it unsuitable for general lists, instructional steps, or other topics unless they can be framed explicitly as a case study.

*   Bottom Navigation Icons (x5)

## Animation Breakdown

The animation creates the experience of unlocking a phone and viewing a social media post.

1.  **Container Entrance:** The main dark blue container slides in smoothly from the right edge of the screen.
2.  **Device & Lock Screen Appearance:** The white smartphone frame materializes instantly within the container, displaying a simple "lock screen" view consisting of a central icon placeholder and a text placeholder below it.
3.  **Unlock & Content Reveal:** The lock screen icon and text slide upward and out of view. Simultaneously, the main video/image content slides up from the bottom of the phone frame to fill the screen, simulating a "swipe to open" gesture.
4.  **UI Overlay Entrance:** Once the main content is in place, all UI overlays—the text block on the bottom-left, the action icons on the right, and the bottom navigation bar—fade in smoothly and concurrently over the content.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** This template is specifically designed to present video or image content in a format that is immediately recognizable as a social media reel (similar to Instagram Reels or TikTok). Its primary function is to showcase content in a familiar, mobile-native context.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** This template is ideal for short-form video ads, product showcases, success stories, or any vertical video content intended for marketing on social platforms. The initial "lock screen" animation provides a creative hook to capture viewer attention before revealing the main content. The UI overlays add a layer of authenticity, making the content feel organic to the platform it's mimicking.
*   **Versatility:** High. Because the main content, all text, and all icons are customizable placeholders, the template can be adapted for any brand or industry. It is perfectly suited for B2C marketing, personal branding, or any campaign aiming for a contemporary, social-media-savvy feel.

# Template 7

## Template Description

Template 7 simulates a modern chatbot or AI assistant interface. The layout consists of two primary zones against a light grey background.

*   **Conversation Area:** The upper portion of the screen where the dialogue appears. This includes a right-aligned, rounded rectangular bubble for the user's prompt and a left-aligned response area. The response area is composed of a circular placeholder for a bot avatar icon and an adjacent dark, rounded rectangular bubble for the bot's text response.
*   **Input Bar:** A persistent, wide, rounded rectangular bar at the bottom of the screen. This bar is fixed with the title "Message Kubicle bot". It contains three predefined action buttons on the left ("+", "Reason", "Search"), a main text input area, and a circular "send" button on the far right.

## Customizable Elements

**Color**
*   Accent Color (used for action buttons, send button, and bot avatar background)
*   Bot Response Bubble background

**Text**
*   User Prompt (the question asked by the user)
*   Bot Response (the answer generated by the bot)

**Icons**
*   Bot Avatar Icon

## Animation Breakdown

The animation fluidly simulates a real-time chat interaction.

1.  **Input Bar Expansion:** The animation begins with the input bar at the bottom expanding horizontally from a compact state to its full width.
2.  **User Input Simulation:** Text types out letter-by-letter into the main input area, simulating a user composing their message.
3.  **Sending the Prompt:** Upon completion, the typed text vanishes from the input bar and reappears above it as a user prompt bubble. This bubble smoothly scales up into view.
4.  **Bot Response Sequence:** A moment later, the bot's response begins.
    *   The circular bot avatar icon scales up into view on the left.
    *   Immediately after, the bot's response bubble scales up into view next to the avatar.
5.  **Bot Text Generation:** Finally, the bot's response text types out letter-by-letter inside its bubble, simulating the AI generating its answer.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** This template is purpose-built to demonstrate a question-and-answer interaction with a chatbot, AI assistant, or generative AI tool. The fixed text "Message Kubicle bot" clearly defines this context.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** This template excels at creating tutorials or feature demonstrations for AI-powered software. Use the user prompt to pose a clear question or command, and use the animated bot response to showcase the tool's capabilities. The typing animation is perfect for syncing with a voice-over that reads the text as it appears.
*   **Versatility:** This is a specialized template with moderate versatility. Its strength lies in its specific use case. Due to the fixed text elements like "Message Kubicle bot" and the specific action buttons ("Reason," "Search"), it is not well-suited for general-purpose lists or informational content outside the context of a simulated application interface.

2.  **Sequential Reveal:** The subsequent pill containers animate in one by one. Each new pill slides smoothly into view from directly underneath the one above it.
3.  **Motion & Easing:** The motion is a crisp vertical slide. As each pill slides up, it settles gently into its final position with a subtle ease-out effect, creating an elegant and satisfying cascading build. The text is contained within the pill and animates along with it.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** This template is designed for presenting a simple, sequential list of items, such as key topics, agenda points, or short takeaways. Its clean, uncluttered design focuses all attention on the text content.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** The cascading animation is ideal for syncing with a voice-over that introduces each point individually. This controlled reveal prevents the viewer from reading ahead and keeps them engaged with the narrator's pace.

    *   The bottom-most list item slides in crisply from the right edge.
    *   This is followed by the third, second, and finally the top list item, each sliding in sequentially from the right. This bottom-to-top reveal creates a dynamic building effect.
3.  **Content Reveal:** The text inside each rectangular container fades in sequentially from top to bottom after the containers have finished their animation, allowing for perfect synchronization with a narrator's script.

## Suitable Use Cases
*   **Intended Function:** This template is built to present a list of up to four related points, features, steps, or items under a single, overarching topic.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** The reverse-order animation (bottom-to-top) is unconventional and attention-grabbing. Use this to build suspense or reveal items in a climactic order. The delayed text fade-in is perfect for pacing the information delivery, allowing the narrator to introduce each point as it appears visually.
*   **Versatility:** With fully customizable text and icons, this is a highly versatile template. It is well-suited for summarizing key takeaways, listing product benefits, outlining an agenda, or presenting steps in a process. Its clean design and dynamic animation make it effective for a wide range of educational and corporate content.

1.  **Title Icons Entrance:** The animation begins with the `+` icon for "Pros" and the `-` icon for "Cons" popping into view simultaneously with a quick scaling effect.
2.  **Title Text Reveal:** Immediately following the icons, the "Pros" and "Cons" text titles are revealed with a rapid wipe-in animation from left to right.
3.  **Sequential List Reveal (Pros):** The focus shifts to the left column. The five "Pros" list item containers animate in sequentially from top to bottom. Each container's outline is "drawn" onto the screen, starting from the left and moving clockwise.
4.  **Sequential List Reveal (Cons):** After the "Pros" list is complete, the "Cons" column follows the exact same animation pattern. Its five list item containers are drawn on screen sequentially from top to bottom.
5.  **Hierarchy:** The animation establishes a clear hierarchy: titles first, then supporting points. It presents the "Pros" list completely before moving to the "Cons," creating a methodical flow ideal for narration.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** Template 14 is purpose-built for creating a direct "Pros and Cons" comparison list. Its fixed titles and icons make its function explicit and unambiguous.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** This template is ideal for weighing the advantages and disadvantages of a product, decision, or strategy. The clear visual separation and sequential animation allow a narrator to build a case by discussing all the positive points first, followed by the negative points, with the on-screen elements reinforcing the spoken content.
*   **Versatility:** Due to its fixed "Pros" and "Cons" titles and corresponding icons, this template has very low versatility. It is specifically designed for this single comparison use case and is not suitable for general-purpose lists, feature highlights, or instructional steps.

# Template 15

## Template Description

Template 15 features a specific and focused layout designed to highlight cautionary points, set against a light grey background. The design is split into two main zones. On the left, there is a fixed title element reading "Limitations" enclosed in a rounded horizontal pill. Directly below the title is a large, prominent icon of a warning triangle. On the right, a vertical stack of four large, rounded rectangular containers serves as placeholders for list items.

## Customizable Elements

**Color**
*   Title Background Pill
*   Main Warning Icon Outline
*   Main Warning Icon Accent (Exclamation Mark)
*   List Item Containers (x4)

**Text**
*   List Item Text (x4)

**Icons**
*   There are no customizable icon placeholders in this template. The warning icon is a fixed thematic element integral to the template's specific purpose.

## Animation Breakdown

1.  **Title & Icon Entrance:** The animation begins with the "Limitations" title pill sliding down smoothly from the top edge. Simultaneously, the outline of the warning icon slides in from the left edge.
2.  **Icon Accent Reveal:** Immediately after the main icon is in place, the exclamation mark within it pops into view with a quick scaling effect, adding emphasis.
3.  **Staggered List Reveal:** The four list item containers on the right animate in sequentially from top to bottom. Each container slides in crisply from the right edge with a slight delay, creating a clean, cascading flow that directs the eye downwards.
4.  **Content Fade-in:** As demonstrated in the video, the text within each container can be timed to fade in sequentially, allowing a narrator to introduce each limitation individually after its container has appeared.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** With its fixed "Limitations" title and integrated warning icon, this template is explicitly designed for a single purpose: to list and explain limitations, warnings, potential risks, or caveats associated with a topic.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** The template's design immediately establishes a cautionary tone. Use the animated list to present a series of clear, concise limitations. The sequential animation is ideal for syncing with a voice-over that elaborates on each point, ensuring the audience fully understands each potential issue before moving to the next.
*   **Versatility:** This is a low-versatility, purpose-built template. Its fixed title and thematic icon make it unsuitable for general-purpose lists, such as outlining benefits, features, or neutral process steps. Its strength lies in its clear, unambiguous communication of cautionary information.

*   **Versatility:** This template has a very specific and focused use case. Due to its fixed title, it is not flexible for other purposes like listing features or steps. Its strength is its professional and clear presentation for introducing people.

# Template 28

## Template Description

Template 28 utilizes a clean, symmetrical layout to present five distinct items side-by-side. The design consists of five identical, vertically-oriented, pill-shaped containers arranged horizontally against a light grey background. Each container is structurally divided into two sections: an upper area for a short text label and a larger, lower area designed to hold a key visual, such as a portrait or icon. This parallel structure is ideal for comparison or for introducing a group of related elements.

## Customizable Elements

**Color**
*   Vertical Pill-Shaped Containers (x5)

**Text**
*   Label Text for each container (x5)

**Images**
*   Image/Icon Placeholder in the lower portion of each container (x5)

## Animation Breakdown

The animation for this template is synchronized and impactful, designed to present all information at once.

1.  **Container Reveal:** The five vertical, pill-shaped containers animate into view simultaneously. They expand vertically from their horizontal midpoint, appearing to stretch both upwards and downwards at the same time until they reach their full height. The motion is quick and crisp.
2.  **Content Entrance:** Immediately after the containers are fully formed, their content animates in. The text labels at the top of each container type on rapidly. Concurrently, the images in the lower portion of each container fade in smoothly. This simultaneous content reveal across all five containers creates a unified and efficient presentation.

## Suitable Use Cases

*   **Intended Function:** This template is specifically designed to introduce or compare a group of up to five distinct entities, such as team members, customer personas, product categories, or organizational roles.
*   **How to Use Effectively:** The layout is perfect for showcasing a team structure (e.g., "CEO," "Manager," "Worker"), different user types, or stakeholders in a project. The simultaneous animation makes it suitable for providing a quick, comprehensive overview of all elements at once, rather than a step-by-step introduction. It works best when you want the audience to see all the components as part of a single, cohesive group.
*   **Versatility:** With fully customizable text, images, and container colors, Template 28 is highly versatile. While it excels at presenting people, it can easily be adapted to compare product features, different plans, or any set of five concepts that can be represented with a distinct visual and a simple label.
